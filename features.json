In time, your carve settings and post-carve feedback will help Easel calculate better settings for all users.\r\n\r\n*Note: Easel Pro subscribers can take full advantage of the Easel Toolbox by using [Easel Pro’s stored cut settings feature](https://easel.inventables.com/features/stored-cut-settings). Bits and materials in your Easel Pro Toolbox with stored custom cut settings will auto-populate for your projects. This streamlines the carve set-up process and improves your project workflow.*\r\n\r\nAdding Bits to Your Toolbox\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n### Adding a custom bit\r\n\r\nBoth Easel and Easel Pro users can add and save custom bits into their Toolbox. Only Easel Pro subscribers, Easel Pro day pass users, and Easel Pro free day users can carve with custom bits in their Toolbox.\r\n\r\n1.  Once you're logged into Easel, click on the Easel icon in the top left corner to open the **Account** pop-up. Click on the **Toolbox** tab.\r\n\r\n2.  Select Bits from the top navigation.\r\n![Open Toolbox](https://inventablesprod.s3.amazonaws.com/general_images/features/mbc/MBC_Bits-1accessToolboxUse.gif)\u0026nbsp;\r\n3.

Make sure you've entered the correct size of your material.\r\n2. Select the part of the design you wish to carve from the tiling menu *Tiling menu*\r\n3. Use the preview to double-check which part of your design will carve.\r\n4. Follow normal carving procedure.\r\n\r\n\u003e NOTE: If you are carving the nth tile, use the first step of the carve modal to see how much you should shift your material in order to carve the next tile.\r\n\r\n##Prepping your material\r\n1. Use material that can be aligned and shifted easily (straight left edge recommended)\r\n2. Mark offsets shown in tile menu before starting the carve\r\n3. Create a guard to slide material against. A 48\" level can be used as a guide.\r\n4. Reuse your last work position in the carve walkthrough when carving your second, third, etc. tiles\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- Even small deviations in the squareness of your CNC or material can result in tile carves not lining up perfectly. Square carefully!\r\n- You must use tile overlap while V-Carving \r\n",
